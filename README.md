# Advanced Prework
To skip the Intro class, you need to demonstrate that you have mastered certain skills, including creating a basic page, calling an API, using HTML & CSS, and using Github.

This project provides the basic instructions for creating a project that will demonstrate these competencies by using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)
and creating a page that allows a user to navigate around the data provided from that api.

## Instructions

Your assignment is to create a basic webpage displaying items from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/). The basic requirements include:
- Creating the HTML for the page
- Styling the elements on the page using CSS
- Retrieving the data to display on the page using JavaScript to fetch the data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) as needed
- Providing a README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage

The content that you decide to use from the api, as well as the way it is displayed, is up to you however at a minimum it should include the following:
 - Display the data for at least 2 of the models in the API (we suggest starting with people and films)
 - Provide a way for the user to navigate from each model's page to the other models that are displayed
  - The simplest version of this would allow going from a person to the films they are in and from a film to the characters in that film
 - Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages

The project should be created as a repository in GitHub and a link to the repository should be submitted for assessment in the assessment form.

## Assessment
Areas that will be included in the assessment include:
- Can we get the code to run without issues by following the instructions in the README file
- Is the site usable to navigate between the different models it loads
- Is the code readable and well structured
- Does it handle error cases
- What type of styling was included

While we do expect to see some custom styling on the site this is primarily an assessment of coding skills and not design strength so a simple set of styling is acceptable.

## Extra
The following are not necessary, but are examples of things that would be nice bonuses:
- A particularly well-designed GUI
- Display and navigation of more than 2 categories of data from the api
- Displaying all of the data associated with each model


## GitHub Resources
Knowing how to use GitHub and upload your work is a requirement for CTD’s advanced classes. If you are proficient in programming fundamentals, but you don’t know how to use GitHub, you can do one of these tutorials:
- https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github
- https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners
- https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github
Feel free to go through these to help learn the system. We do require your pre-work submission to be in GitHub. 

Thank you, and happy coding!
